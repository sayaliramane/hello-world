1.	A gateway is a network point that acts as an entarance to another network. Or it is an interface between two networks.
2.	Basically it is a router or proxy server that routes between the networks.
3.	 A network gateway can be implemented completely in software, completely in hardware, or as a combination of both. Depending on the types of protocols they support
4.	Because a network gateway, by definition, appears at the edge of a network, related capabilities like firewalls tend to be integrated with it. On home networks, a broadband routertypically serves as the network gateway although ordinary computers can also be configured to perform equivalent functions.
5.	A gateway may contain devices such as protocol translators, impedance matching devices, rate converters, fault isolators, or signaltranslators as necessary to provide system interoperability.
